## Project Overview

The main task involves analyzing the **Blue Nile diamond dataset** to explore relationships between the variables and address specific claims about diamonds. The project includes:

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**
   - Use data visualizations to explore how **price** is related to other variables:
     - **Carat**
     - **Clarity**
     - **Color**
     - **Cut**
   - Investigate how these variables relate to each other.
   - Address various claims from the diamond education page on the Blue Nile website.

2. **Regression Analysis**
   - Fit an appropriate **simple linear regression model** for **price** against **carat**.
